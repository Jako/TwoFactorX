<p>You are receiving this email because two-factor authentication has been activated for your account. To use two-factor authentication, you need a supported device or an application that generates a time-based one-time password (TOTP), e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy or 1Password. Without an authentication key, you can only log in once. If you have successfully logged in, you will only receive your QR code and will be logged out immediately.</p>
<p>Open the authentication application and scan the QR code provided. Once this process has been successfully completed, a new authentication key will be displayed in the authentication application every 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Please note. The QR code is only visible on the screen for 60 seconds.</strong></p>
